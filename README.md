# API Maturity Model


The API Maturity Model was written out of frustration and a deep desire to make life easier for security professionals and developers alike.
 
 * Simple model that can be used to evaluate products for basic functionality
 * Can be included in RFC's or tenders to make life easier for procurement
 * Can be used by development teams to ensure they're developing their API's with security in mind

I speak about the model on the [Pivotal Podcast](https://content.pivotal.io/podcasts/a-checklist-for-api-security-with-wim-remes).
